# TitanicDataProject

This is a tutorial in an IPython Notebook for the Kaggle competition, Titanic Machine Learning From Disaster. 
The goal of this repository is to provide an example of a competitive analysis for those interested in getting into the field of data analytics or using python for Kaggle's Data Science competitions .

Goal for this Project:<br/>
Show a simple example of an analysis of the Titanic disaster in Python using a full complement of PyData utilities.
Answer questions based on data:<br/><br/>
1.) Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages,Gender,Class,..etc)<br/>
2.) What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?<br/>
3.) Where did the passengers come from?<br/>
4.) Who was alone and who was with family?<br/>
5.) What factors helped someone survive the sinking?

This Notebook will show basic examples of:<br/><br/>
Data Handling<br/>
Importing Data with Pandas<br/>
Cleaning Data<br/>
Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib<br/>
Data Analysis<br/>
